# ⚠️ Deprecated ⚠️
This repo is archived and deprecated, the extensions demonstrated were popular up to 
Axon Ivy LTS 10. 

With LTS 12 however, these extensions no longer work, 
since they use a (SWT based) UI that is not ready for the web based Process Editor.

What's more, for the TimedStart beans, there is a built-in successor called 
the TimerBean.

# BPM Beans
A collection of free Axon Ivy process extensions.

## [ETHEREUM](blockchain-beans/README.md)
